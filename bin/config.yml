#  - Config Info -
#All Configuration Options should be "true" or "false".
#Do not capitalize "true" or "false".

#If you break the config and don't know what to do, save this
#file to your desktop, delete the config.yml found in your server,
#and reload or restart your server. A new one will generate,
#and you can copy your old settings back into the freshly
#generated file.
#==============================================================
#  - Plugin Information -
information:
    #Do not modify "configVersion". This is how HorseStats knows if
    #you need to regen a new config. If you change this, your config
    #may not work and might break the plugin.
    configVersion: 3.02
    #Do not modify this. This is not used by the plugin itself, but
    #is here for you to know what CraftBukkit version HorseStats can
    #run on without entering "cripple mode".
    HorseStats Is Running: craftbukkit-1.7.9-R0.1
#==============================================================
#  - Configuration Options -
#Quick note regarding a new setting and its relationship to others:
#saddleLock and nonOwnerHorseInteraction are two different mechanisms.
#Read this carefully and make sure you set it up as you really want it.

#nonOwnerHorseInteraction, when set to false, will nullify any and every
#attempt to right click a horse by someone who is not the owner. saddleLock,
#when set to true, will nullify any attempts to right click a horse
#by someone who is not the owner, IF, the horse has a saddle on.

#Alright, now to config options.
options:
    #Allow horses to be killable by players who don't own them?
    #When false, this will block melee and arrows of non-owners.
    horseGrief: false

    #Allow use of the "launch" argument for /slayhorse?
    horseLaunch: true

    #Should saddled horses be only accessible by their owners,
    #and unsaddled horses accessible to anyone?
    saddleLock: true

    #Should someone be able to interact with a horse that is not theirs?
    nonOwnerHorseInteraction: true

    #Should horses be able to teleport between worlds?
    #IMPORTANT: Initial testing showed that horse data for the entire
    #server could be lost if this is allowed.
    allowMultiWorldTeleport: false

#  - Translation -
#This section contains every translatable string of text in HorseStats.

#If you want HorseStats to appear in a language other than English,
#this is where you change things. If you are fine with English,
#leave this alone. 

#Simply translate the text after each node into whatever language
#you want. As long as you do not modify the node, there is no wrong
#way to do this.

#Sorry, but console log messages will still be hard coded as English.
